This is a small game that runs on the console app using C# code. Made in Visual Studio 2022.

The goal of this game is to raise your affection points with your cat (whom you may name, feed, pet, play, and bathe) in 7 in-game days.
This project mostly serves to help familiarize myself with C# and object-oriented programming. This does NOT save in between runs. 


It is named Tyrus because the very first cat named here was Tyrus.
